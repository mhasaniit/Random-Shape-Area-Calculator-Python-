For my final project, ITM 313 I Developed a Python program that works with basic geometric shapes (circle, square, and cuboid) using object‑oriented programming. The program randomly creates a list of shapes, calculates their areas or surface area, and lets the user choose how to see the results: in the terminal, saved to a text file, or shown in a simple Tkinter window. This project helped strengthen my understanding of classes, encapsulation, shared methods for different shapes, user input handling, and introductory GUI development in Python.
